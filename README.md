PCT-PREDICTION


This repository contains the XGBoost and Random Forest machine learning models which are designed to predict whether procalcitonin (PCT) levels exceed 0.5 ng/mL using commonly available laboratory tests. The model utilizes complete blood count (CBC) parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine (Cr) levels to provide a binary prediction of PCT levels, enabling clinicians to optimize testing and antibiotic stewardship.
